    "In Integration Skills 2 - Water Quality, you will focus on extending the integrated numerical water balance model of the Forum ponds on the Wageningen University campus you built in *Integration Skills 1*. Again, you will describe the Forum ponds - or your group's land unit, but now focusing on water quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Integration Skills 1, you developed a quantitative, time explicit, water balance model. You composed the model formulation with simple terms. Later, you paid attention to better describing evaporation $E$, and lateral and vertical water flows $Q$-terms. You found that the water volume in the pond has a seasonal cycle, which changes depending on the terms in the water balance. You also spent time on the sensitivity of the model to the value of the initail volume and lateral inflow.\n",

    "Note that the \"Jupyter notebook\" practical consists of so-called code cells and markdowns cells. Markdown cells are used to write text, pose questions, and for you to write your notes. Code cells are used to write parts of a numerical code or program. In each code cell we write a necessary part of a code and we write some comments that start with the mark \"#\". In the comment, we explain (again) what we calculate or plot. To obtain a result of a calculation i.e., a figure (note that most of the calculations we have already done for you), you will need to run a cell. You can do that by clicking on a cell and pressing simultaneously **Shift Enter**. Only then you will be able to see the result of the calculation and only then will the figures appear on your screen. Happy notebooking!\n",

    "## 2 Water quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The water quality may be described in a similar way as the water quantity, using a mass balance of the nutrients or pollutants in the water. It is important to realise that we are interested in the concentration, but that it is difficult to formulate a conservation equation for concentration. For example, if the pond’s water volume changes because of addition of clean rainwater, the concentration changes. But at the same time the total amount of nutrients in the pond stays the same. Therefore, we will formulate the model in terms of mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, you will describe the nitrogen cycle of the Forum ponds, including ammonium (NH$_3$) and nitrate (NO$_3$). We will not consider the Phosphorus cycle, that you learned how to quantify in the Basic Skills Soil Quality. Although the Phosphorus cycle would be very relevant, it would make the model too complex for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "After constructing the nitrogen balance model, you will apply it to verify the seasonal cycle of water quality, the risk for green or blue algae using the Redfield ratio, and the pond’s transparency in terms of Secchi depth. Ultimately, you will quantify how many people can healthily swim in the Forum ponds, considering the risk of bacterial diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Nitrogen conservation equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms in the nitrogen balance equation are partly comparable to the water quantity balance we learned about in Integration Skills 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{dm_n}{dt} = P \\times C_{N,P}+Q_{k,in} \\times C_{N,Q_{k,in}}-Q_{k,out} \\times C_{N,pond}+Q_{l,in} \\times C_{N,Q_{l,in}}-Q_{l,out} \\times C_{N,pond}+F_{NH_3}+F_{den}+F_{exc}+\\Delta m_{N,bio}.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The components of this equation are nitrogen in precipitation $P$ (mm s$^{-1}$) and nitrogen in lateral $Q_{l,in}$ (mm s$^{-1}$) and vertical inflow $Q_{k,in}$ (mm s$^{-1}$). The nitrogen concentrations $C_{N,P}$, $C_{N,Q_{k,in}}$, and $C_{N,Q_{l,in}}$ in those inputs are determined externally. You measured those as a part of Basic Skills Aquatic Ecology (see map in the introductory lecture on Brightspace). Nitrogen outputs from the pond are lateral and vertical outflows $Q_{l,out}$ and $Q_{k,out}$ (mm s$^{-1}$). The concentrations in these outputs depend on the concentration in the pond, which is the very variable you are trying to resolve. Nitrogen can also be added by dry deposition $F_{NH_3}$ (that you analysed in Basic Skills Air Quality), by denitrification $F_{den}$ (decomposition of organic matter) or by excreta from geese, ducks, gulls and other waterfowl ($F_{exc}$). Additionally, nitrogen may be fixed by aquatic vegetation and/or algae ($m_{N,bio}$). This nitrogen is removed from the water as ammonium or nitrate, but remains latently present until decomposition of the organic material. This term is somewhat complex, because algae may also be removed with lateral outflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, you need to integrate the partial differential equation to obtain the nitrogen mass in time:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "m_{N,t} = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\frac{dm_N}{dt}dt.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since integral is difficult to solve with computer models, you can solve it numerically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "m_{N,t+\\Delta t} = m_{N,t}+\\frac{dm_N}{dt}\\times \\Delta t.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "You may see the similarity to the water quantity balance equation. There is one practical difference however: the water volume reacts rapidly to changes in inputs and outputs, and the maximum volume is fixed. The volume reaches equilibrium within one or two years. The nitrogen mass, however, reacts much more slowly. It may take five to ten years for it to reach equilibrium, or even longer. Moreover, the nitrogen mass does not have a maximum. Therefore, setting the initial concentration in the pond $C_{N,pond,ini}$ needs more attention than just setting the initial volume."

    "\n",
    "To construct the water quality model, we will follow the same procedure as for the water quantity model (used in the Integration Skills 1). Thus, first implement the tendency terms with simplistic values, then add up the tendency terms into $dm_N/dt$ and integrate the model in time. \n",

As such they are different from physical constants which are fixed in all conditions. In this situation, they are the time step `dt` [h], surface area of the pond A [m$^2$], maximum level of the pond `d_max` [m], deepest level of the pond `d_min` [m] and maximum volume of the pond `V_max` [m$^3$].\n",
    "</li><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><p style=\"background:powderblue;color:black\">Now, let's prepare some tendency terms. For that, you need the concentrations in the inflows (i.e., concentration in precipitation `C_N_P`, lateral inflow C_N_Ql_in and vertical inflow C_N_Qk_in).</ul>\n",

    "Next, let's add the dry deposition rate you calculated in the Basic Skills Air Quality. If you worked correctly through your *Basic Skills Air Quality* notebook you should have saved a matrix at it's end. In that matrix you saved the calculated dry deposition flux $F_{NH_3}$ ($\\mu$g m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$). Here, you will first load that matrix and the necessary content, i.e., the dry deposition rates for three stations that the calculations were made for. Then, you will convert the units to g h$^{-1}$ using the surface area of the lake and 3600 h$^{-1}$. Next, you will convert the mass of NH$_3$ to the mass of only the nitrogen N, using the atom masses of N and H. Finally, you will calculate the wet deposition rate by multiplying the precipitation rate $P$ in m$^3$ h$^{-1}$ with concentration in precipitation C_N_P (that was defined in the previous cell box).

Particularly when the sun shines and air temperature approaches tropical values, algae and bacteria may be a problem for water quality. The next question is how to define ‘safe swimming conditions in (natural) surface water’? Two issues are of main concern here: clear vision under water and health. The standards for safe swimming water are based on these two criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "For security reasons, a minimum visibility of 1 m has been defined as the limit. If visibility is lower, it becomes difficult to detect objects (like trees or bicycles) that have been 'fallen' in the water. Also, with low visibility it becomes difficult to assess how deep the water is and that is of importance if one wants to dive. For health reasons, it would be beneficial if not too many sick making bacteria are in the water system. Especially bacteria present in the faeces of humans and animals my turn people very sick. Those bacteria should be limited to a below a maximum level. It is also very annoying if one gets swimmers itch, but this topic is beyond the scope of the course.\n",

    "A so-called secchi disk can be used to determine how far light penetrates into the water column. The secchi disk is a black and white coloured disk on a rope with depth marks. To use it, you should slowly sink the disk in the water column, just until you don’t see the disk anymore. Note the depth. Now, you should slowly lift the disk until you see it again. Note the depth again. The average of the two values is the Secchi depth at that moment. Standards for visibility have been set to minimally 0.4 m for all surface waters and 1.0 m for natural swimming waters.\n",

Especially phosphorus and nitrogen are important for the growth of these algae. If the concentrations of available phosphorus and nitrogen in the water are known, it is possible to calculate how much algal biomass this will yield, assuming that all available nutrients are taken up by the algae. The algal composition is C106H175O42N16P. Corresponding molar weights are C (12), H (1), O (16), N (14) and P (31) which are all expressed in g/mol. Hoyer et al.
